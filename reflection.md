# What was I most proud of?

I found that programming the sprits to fire at he first target coming at to fire in that direction was the most challanging part.

# what would I change if I started now?

and i thnk if i started now (and had more than about a month) i would start with placing and moving the sprites and then not use a class to 
display any of te sprites(it works just bad idea if you want it to be easy).

# What am I most proud of?

i am most proud of is how many nights i can go with out sleep........(im jk).

i am most proud of my calsses to display my sprites and to move my sprites.
